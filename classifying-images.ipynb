This is partly true: one of the characteristics of Deep learning is that you can find interesting features from the training dataset itself, and this a priori is easier when you have many examples available, especially in the case of having input datasets with a high dimensionality, such as images.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what constitutes a \"large\" dataset is relative. Specifically relative to the size and depth of the network we are trying to train. It is not possible to sand a convnet so that it becomes a complete problem with only a few dozen examples, but a few hundred can be enough if the model is well assembled (we will understand what \"well assembled\" means throughout the Deep Learning course).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since convnets learn local characteristics, invariant under translations, they are very efficient in terms of the number of images needed to carry out perceptual problems. So training a convnet from 0 with a not very large dataset can still lead to reasonable results as we will see here.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is more: Deep Learning models are highly \"recyclable\". One can, for example, take an image classification problem and a trained speech-to-text converter on a very big dataset and then reuse it for solving a completely different problem only by adding some small modifications. More specifically, in the case of Computer Vision, many pre-trained models (usually trained on the ImageNet dataset) are made public so that one can download them and use them to create powerful Computer Vision models with very little data.\n",

We start using 150x150 input images (an arbitrary choice), and end up with feature maps that are 7x7 in size before the flattening layer.\n",

To do this we can use the flow_from_directory to take the images directly from the folders that we previously generated. We give it as input the folders where the training (or validation) images are, the size of the images (target_size), the size of the batch we're going to use (we're going to start with 20) and as there are only two categories, we tell it that we're going to use binary_crossentropy (class_mode).

    "Cuando corrimos el primer modelo observamos que teníamos un acierto muy cercano a 1 a la hora de entrenar. Sin embargo, para el testeo se observó que el accuracy era del 65%. Por tanto, se podía establecer que el problema era de varianza. Hemos corrido múltiples modelos sin obtener grandes resultados, ya que solamente hemos conseguido aumentar la accuracy hasta un 72% y mejorar la velocidad, pasando de 60-70s (con train, con validacion es 30-40 s) por época a 20-30 s por época. Entonces barajamos tres posibilidades principales:\n",
    "+ Más datos: Nos da un mejor resultado ligeramente mejor porque si entrenamos con train aumentamos un 70 de accuracy a 72.\n",
    "+ Regularización: Es la técnica con la que hemos obtenido mejores resultados. Hemos aplicado en todas las capas una regularización l2 con lambda 0.001 y un Dropout en mitad de la parte convolucional de 0.5, para intentar simplificar la red y que algún nodo se pueda sobrespecializar. Del mismo modo lo hemos ido variando, con reg l1, más capas de dropout, cambiando los parámetros de regularización, meter spatialDropout ...\n",
    "+ Otra estructura de red: Hemos probado a hacer diferentes redes, con diferentes capas de convolución, con AVGPooling, redes más grandes, más pequeñas... pero no hemos logrado obtener un resultado satisfactorio con ellas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Porr último hemos realizado cambios en el optimizador que nos han dado mejores resultados para el accuracy y la velocidad. Hemos decidido utilizar ADAM Optimization ya que combina SGD con Momentum y RMSprop y por lo general ADAM parece que tiene un buen funcionamiento."
